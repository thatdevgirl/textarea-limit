Text Area Limit (using YUI)
====================

__Author:__ Joni Halabi (www.thatdevgirl.com)

Description
-----------

This text area limit widget was developed as a proof of concept for implementing a character limit inside a text area. Character limits are not built into text area fields just yet as they are with input fields, so it is necessary to have a Javascript implementation if you need to limit the input prior to submitting your form.  This implementation was written for a client project, which required YUI 2.7. 

What is in the Javascript?
-------------------------------------

This project contains all of the applicable YUI 2.7 libraries in the /scripts/yui directory.  All of the customization required for the text area field is in the textarea-limit.js file.

What is in the CSS?
-------------------

This project contains 2 CSS files:

1. __reset.css:__ Just a basic CSS reset, inspired by the Eric Meyers' CSS reset. 

2. __textarea-limit.css:__ Contains the base CSS for the text area limit widget.
